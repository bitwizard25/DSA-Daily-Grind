# 🗓️ DAY 7 — Hashing: Sets & Week 1 Review

> 💡 **Core Insight:** Only start counting from the **beginning** of a sequence. This turns what looks O(N²) into O(N).

### 🟡 Problem 1: Longest Consecutive Sequence
- **Approach:** Hash set of all numbers. Only count from `num` if `num-1` is NOT in set.
- **Complexity:** O(N) time | O(N) space

```cpp
int longestConsecutive(vector<int>& nums) {
    unordered_set<int> s(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    int maxLen = 0;
    for (int num : s) {
        if (!s.count(num - 1)) { // start of sequence
            int cur = num, len = 1;
            while (s.count(cur + 1)) { cur++; len++; }
            maxLen = max(maxLen, len);
        }
    }
    return maxLen;
}
```

### 📚 Week 1 Revision Session
Go back through Days 1–6. For each pattern, answer:
- What is the core insight in one sentence?
- What is the time/space complexity?
- What edge case almost tripped you?

| Pattern | One-Line Core Insight |
|---------|----------------------|
| Prefix Sum | Precompute → O(1) range query |
| Two Pointers | Sorted array → converge to eliminate pairs |
| Sliding Window | Expand right, shrink left, never restart |
| Hashing | Pay O(N) space to get O(1) lookup |

### ✅ Day 7 Checklist
- [ ] Longest Consecutive Sequence without looking at notes
- [ ] Re-solve one problem from Days 1–5 you felt shaky on
- [ ] Write all 4 pattern insights from memory
